# Privacy Policy for Doge my Site

**Effective Date:** July 31, 2025

Thank you for installing "Doge my Site" (the "Extension"). Your privacy is very important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information is used and how we handle data in partnership with third-party services.

## 1. Core Principle: We Don't Collect Your Data

"Doge my Site" is designed to be a private and secure experience. Our extension's code does not personally collect, store, log, or share any of your personal information.

* **We do not collect Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** such as your name, email address, or physical address.
* **We do not track your Browse history** across different websites.

## 2. How the Extension Works

The sole function of "Doge my Site" is to modify the content of the webpage you are currently viewing.

* The Extension works entirely locally on your computer, within your web browser.
* It reads the content of the active tab to find images and text to replace with Doge-related memes.
* To display GIFs, the extension makes a request to the Giphy API to fetch relevant GIF data. This process is explained in the "Third-Party Services" section below.
* This page content is analyzed in real-time and is **never** transmitted to our servers.

## 3. Third-Party Services: Giphy

To provide the GIFs for memeifying pages, we use the Giphy API.

When the extension needs to load a GIF, it sends a request directly from your browser to Giphy's servers. As with any standard internet connection, this request includes your IP address. Giphy may use your IP address and other data from the request in accordance with their own privacy practices.

We do not send any personal information to Giphy. We only request the GIF content. We strongly encourage you to review **[Giphy's Privacy Policy](https://support.giphy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032872931-GIPHY-Privacy-Policy)** to understand how they collect and use data.

## 4. Permissions

For the Extension to function, it requires permission to "read and change your data on the websites you visit." This permission is required *only* so the Extension can perform its core function of "memeifying" the page content. We repeat: your page data is processed locally and is never recorded or sent to our servers.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, especially if our use of third-party services changes. Any changes will be posted on the Extension's page on the Chrome Web Store. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
